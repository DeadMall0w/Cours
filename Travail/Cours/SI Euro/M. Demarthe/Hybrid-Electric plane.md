Hello, I'm going to present to you hybrid electric plane
First what is it.
It's a type of airplane that is using both eletrical and fuel energy to fly, 
Thanks to the use of electricity it produce less greenhouse gas, it reduced noise, enhanced the range of the plane and create a greener alternatives to traditional plane.
It works thanks to batteries that are filled before and during the fly, and a fuel tanks that supply thanks to the powerboard to the electric engine and combustion engine that create mechanical energy that rotate turbines and let the plane fly.
There are 2 types of architetures solution; the parrallel, where both the electric engine and combustion engine rotate the same turbine, and the serial achitecture where each engine has his own turbines.
Hybrid electric plane are a good alternatives to traditional planes, because they are create less greenhous gases, less noise, but they still have a long way to go, because they reduce the fuel comsuption of only 5% for now.
